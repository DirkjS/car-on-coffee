=============

Car with arduino &amp; firmata driven by phone and coffeescript

Just an experiment to use sensor data from a phone to drive a four motor car. The arduino drives four motors with two pololu DDRV8853 motordrivers. On the arduino [firmata](https://github.com/jgautier/firmata) is loaded. The app.coffee starts a server to read the sensor data on an iPhone or iPad. This is all based on [sensitive-arduino](https://github.com/alanreid/Sensitive-Arduino) from Alan Reid.
